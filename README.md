# CRT Snake (Pygame Version)  
*Dynamic CRT-Skinned Snake Game with Retro Glow and Style Swaps*

This is a stylized version of the classic Snake game, built using **Pygame** and designed to mimic the aesthetics of old-school CRT monitors. Every 5 points, the game seamlessly cycles between retro themes — glowing green terminals, amber monochrome IBM screens, and chunky blue Commodore-style modes.

It’s more than just a skin swap — each theme comes with custom visual artifacts like **scanlines**, **ghost trails**, **pixel noise**, **banding effects**, and a **live-reactive beamline** that pulses across the screen in real-time.

> _Built with the help of ChatGPT and Claude — my best AI pair programmers.  
> I didn’t write a single line myself in this one — just directed the vibe and let the AIs code it out.  
> Don’t feel guilty about using AI. It’s a superpower for fast prototyping and turning wild ideas into real builds._
